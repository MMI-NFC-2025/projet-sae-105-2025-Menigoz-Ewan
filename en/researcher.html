                            Mary Anning was born on May 21, 1799, in Lyme Regis, a small coastal town in England. She
                            was one of ten children of Richard and Mary Anning, but only Mary and her older brother
                            Joseph survived infancy. The family was modest; her father supplemented his income by
                            collecting and selling "curiosities"—fossils found on the local cliffs—to tourists.

                            At 15 months old, she was struck by lightning while being held by a neighbor who was killed
                            in the storm. Mary was the only one to survive.

                            job because the cliffs were unstable.

                            ever discovered—a marine reptile that would upend understanding of prehistoric life.

                            Mary Anning's discoveries played a major role in the evolution of paleontology and
                            contributed to debates on evolution and extinction of species.
                        </p>

                        <p class="impact__paragraph">
                            A victim of the Matilda Effect, her work was often attributed to male scientists who bought
                            her fossils and published papers without mentioning her name.
                        </p>

                        <p class="impact__paragraph">
                            Through her discoveries, Mary Anning provided irrefutable evidence of the existence of
                            extinct species.
                        </p>

                        <p class="impact__paragraph">
                            This contradicted the prevailing religious belief that no species could disappear.
                        </p>

                        <p class="impact__paragraph">
                            By demonstrating that entire life forms once existed but are now extinct, Mary Anning not
                            only validated the notion of extinction but also supported the idea of a timescale far
                            greater than that suggested by religious texts.
